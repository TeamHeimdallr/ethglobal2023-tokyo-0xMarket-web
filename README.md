## Description

### Addressing Data Sovereignty Challenges in Web2 and Web3

The sovereignty of data has always been an issue, especially in web2 where trading game and SNS
accounts are forbidden by service terms but still creates significant market. Account holders only
hold a limited license, and the account belongs to the company. Your account actually belongs to the
web2 company! In web3, tradable assets like fungible and non-fungible tokens have gained some
sovereignty, but non-tradable things still have untapped value.

### 0xMarket: Unlocking Value through Tradable Assets and Ownership Transfer

Thanks to ERC-4337 and account abstraction, 0xMarket enables trading of non-tradable assets by
transferring ownership. Our platform offers several benefits, including the creation of new value
streams such as trading of whitelist spots or early-stage investor wallets. Additionally, it helps
users quickly adapt to the ecosystem by finding their ideal wallet. For instance, if a user wants to
play a web3 game that requires a different set of NFTs and levels to play, they can buy a game
account to kick-start the game. This new incentive also provides original users with additional
motivation to put in more effort and contribute to the game.

### Ensuring Ethical Trading and Asset Differentiation in a Decentralized Marketplace

To prevent adversarial use cases like trading identity-related assets, listing accounts must burn
credential-related assets before listing on our platform. Ethical concerns regarding transferring
credential assets stem from the contract account itself, not our platform. Due to the nature of
transferable ownership, it's crucial for the community and service providers to differentiate
between assets issued to a contract address and those issued only to EOA. As a decentralized
marketplace, we won't determine which assets can be traded; instead, the issuing service should make
that decision.
